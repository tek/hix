-- | Goals for these deps:
--
-- Unless stated otherwise, packages have an installed version, 1.0.1, and a latest available version, 1.2.1, which will
-- be their candidate.
--
-- - @base@ is marked as non-reinstallable in Cabal, so it will never produce a plan that includes a different version
--   than its installed one, 4.12.0.0.
--   Its mutation is excluded from being built by matching its name, so it will only be in the solver bounds, and
--   therefore still get a managed bound, version and initial entry in the state file, but no override.
--
-- - @direct1@ The candidate has a dep on @direct2 ==1.2.1@, so the solver chooses 1.2.1 for both deps in the first
--   mutation, which succeeds.
--
-- - @direct2@ has been updated to the latest version by the mutation for @direct1@ and will try the same version again,
--   resulting in success.
--
-- - @direct3@ has the latest version 1.2.1, for which the build fails.
--   It will be tried again in the second iteration, where it will fail once more.
--   It will not be bumped, but an upper bound will be added based on its installed version, 1.0.1, as @<1.1@.
--   No override will be added to the state.
--   TODO We could use multiple condidates, between the latest version and the maximum of the prior upper bound and the
--   installed version.
--   Probably only the latest in each major.
--
-- - @direct4@ has preexisting managed bounds, @^>=1.0@.
--   The candidate succeeds, so the lower bound will be preserved, to yield the final bounds, @>=1.0 && <1.3@.
--   It has an existing entry in @initial@, which will be preserved.
--
-- - @direct5@ has an existing override for version 1.1.1, which will be replaced by the successful candidate 1.2.1.
--   It has a dependency on @direct4@ with an upper bound of <1.2, which would prevent it from being selected by the
--   solver if we didn't use @AllowNewer@.
--
--   @local2@ is in a different env, so it will be treated as a mutable dependency despite being a local package.
--   It also has no installed version, since it isn't available on Hackage (yet) and therefore isn't present in nix;
--   and because packages from other envs aren't added as local derivations to the solver GHC.
--   It also has the bound @<0.9@ in the config (but not the existing state) that prevents other mutations from building
--   with @0.9.0@, which would break the build.
--
--   @local3@ is like @local2@ and exists primarily to ensure that none of the two deps can be mutated without the
--   constraint that keeps the other below 0.9.
--
--   @local4@ is like @local2@ and @local3@, with the slight variation that it has a buildable version 0.10.0, which
--   is not used for prior mutations (rather, like the other two, it uses 0.8.0), but its own mutation succeeds.
