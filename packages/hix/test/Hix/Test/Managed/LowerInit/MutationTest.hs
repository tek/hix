-- | Goals for these deps:
--
-- - @direct1@ will have three available versions and build successfully for the third one, 1.0.5, which will be added
--   to the overrides. Its bound will be @>=1.0.5@.
--   It also has a lower bound, 5.0, in the flake config, which is ignored.
--
-- - @direct2@ builds successfully with its lowest version 5.0, but @direct3@ restricts its version to 5.0.5, which
--   will be in the final state as lower bound and override.
--   It has preexisting managed bounds that will be printed as a diff.
--   Its upper bound from the user config will be retained, replacing the managed bound.
--   It also has a preexisting entry in the overrides of another env, @latest@, which will be retained.
--
-- - @direct3@ has a preexisting entry in `initial`, so it will be ignored completely as a candidate, since we want to
--   be able to run @lower.init@ after @lower.optimize@ without resetting all lower bounds to the initial states.
--   It has preexisting managed bounds that will be printed as a diff.
--
-- - @direct4@ is a dependency of two targets that have no dependency on each other, but one of them has a stricter
--   version requirement, so that the build fails for @<= direct4-1.0.2@ in @local1@ but only for @direct4-1.0.1@ in
--   @local4@.
--
-- - @direct5@ is a dependency of @local5@, which is not part of the target set.
--   The managed bounds for @local5@ in the initial file should be preserved and unchanged (save for version range
--   normalization), and @direct5@ should never appear in the solver and build deps.
--
-- - @local6@ is a cross-env dependency of @local7@ and should be omitted from the overrides in @lower-special@.
--   It has a dependency on @direct3@, which is not among the direct dependencies of @lower-special@, therefore being
--   excluded from the solver params when mutating @local7@.
--   Even though @direct3@ has a lower bound in @lower-main@, 1.0.1, it is treated as a regular transitive dep, and the
--   solver chooses the latest matching version for it.
--   Since the pre-existing, exclusive, upper bound in the deps of @local6@ is 1.5, the chosen version is the
--   next-lower, 1.4.
--   This version is written to the overrides for @lower-special@, like any non-installed transitive dep.
